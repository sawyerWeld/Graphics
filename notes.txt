Todo List for Graphics Project

Would like to be able to make a shape appear like
'Circle(50,50,10)' and have it just appear
maybe could be shapes.circle, but would prefer it to not be

demo:
from graphics_demo import *
start_drawing()
circle(50,50,10)

this would be all thats required for a circle to pop up
